When those of us who are used to writing code in languages like JavaScript and Python, it can be difficult to wrap our heads around the *borrowing* feature that Rust uses to increase memory efficiency. While it may seem like just another programming concept you just have to learn, it is actually a very important feature of Rust that allows programmers to create fast and memory-safe applications. Let's explore a little bit about borrowing in Rust.

## What is borrowing?
Let's start with the most basic programming concept: the variable.

```rust
fn main() {
	let x = String::from("test");
}
```

Here we have added a variable called `x` to memory that has the value of `"test"`. Not too complicated, right? Right now, the `main` function has **ownership** of the `x` variable. Now, let's use our variable in a function:

```rust
fn add_one(string:String) {
	println!("x + 1 = {}1", string);
}
fn main() {
	let x = String::from("test");
	add_one(x);
}
```

Something very important to note here: When we call the function `add_one` in this example, the x value is passed into the function. That's it. It's gone. It can no longer be used after this point. For example, if we tried to do this:

```rust
fn add_one(string:String) {
	println!("x + 1 = {}1", string);
}
fn main() {
	let x = String::from("test");
	add_one(x);
 	println!("{}", x); //This won't work!
}
```

We will get an error saying `borrow of moved value: "x"`. This happens because `x` is essentially no longer there. When we pass `x` to `add_one`, it remains in memory until `add_one` is completed or it gets passed somewhere else. 

So how do we use `x` in our function without losing ownership of the variable? That's where borrowing comes in.

## References
In Rust, you can pass a **reference** to a variable in memory without actually changing its ownership. This is great! This makes it harder to accidentally leak data in applications. But how do we do it?

To pass a reference to a variable, we need to add an `&` in front of the variable name:

```rust
fn add_one(string:String) {
	println!("x + 1 = {}1", string);
}
fn main() {
	let x = String::from("test");
	add_one(&x); //This won't work yet
 	println!("{}", x);
}
```

Great! Now the function `add_one` is **borrowing** the value of `x` without actually taking ownership of it. However, we need to change one more thing to make this compile. If we run this function now, we will get the following message: 

```rust_errors
add_one(&x);
  |     ------- ^^ expected struct `String`, found `&String`
  |     |
  |     arguments to this function are incorrect
```

This is because when we defined our function, we said that the `string` variable would be of type `String`. We need to change this so that the function will expect a reference instead. Luckily, all we have to do is add `&` in front of the parameter in the function definition:

```rust
fn add_one(string:&String) {
	println!("x + 1 = {}1", string);
}
fn main() {
	let x = String::from("test");
	add_one(&x);
 	println!("{}", x);
}
```

Great! Now, when we run this function, we will see the following:

```terminal
x + 1 = test1
test
```

## Conclusion: Focusing on Memory Safety
Having this capability built-in to the compiler is one of the many reasons that programmers are shifting their focus to Rust. Other programming languages, such as JavaScript and Python, use **garbage collection** to determine when to remove an item from memory. This makes work easier for the programmer, but it comes with a high performance cost. It also makes it easier for *you*, the programmer, to not pay attention to how memory is being stored in your application.

This is one of the many features that I love about Rust. The Rust compiler forces you to focus on these important parts of our applications, making the end result a **much** more memory-safe product.
