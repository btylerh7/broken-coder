When you first start to learn programming, there is one statement you will hear **all the time**. 
That statement is "Start contributing to open source". But for many of us, myself included,
contributing to open source can be daunting at first. My first time submitting a pull request to a
repository, I was extremely nervous.

Especially if you are self-taught or just recently started programming, it can be nerve-wracking to
make changes to a codebase. "What if I completely screw up the project?" However, you do not need to worry about this. Your code will be reviewed before
your pull request is merged, so it is unlikely that you will cause any major problems with the program. And if bugs arise, they can be fixed!
