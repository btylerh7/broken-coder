import Video from '../../components/Video.astro'

Teaching at an online school has provided me with many opportunities to utilize my programming skills to create meaningful and impactful projects. 

When I discovered the React library called Remotion, I immediately knew what I would be using it for. 

## The Purpose of the Video
This week, my students have an assignment that has them do the following:

1. Choose a pop star and find an article about whether or not they use autotune.
2. Write a short summary of the article and state your opinions on autotune in general.
3. Save as pdf and upload to the online classroom folder (we call them dropboxes).


## The Setup
To initiate the Remotion project, all you have to do is run `yarn create video` (or `npm init video`) to create a starter project. 

*NOTE: you need nodejs and ffmpeg installed. See [**the installation guide**](https://www.remotion.dev/docs/) for more information!*

Remotion works by creating **compositions** and importing them into the `Video.tsx` file. This file is like the home for your entire video. Here is what the main Video component looks like:

```typescript
import { Composition} from 'remotion'
import { Intro } from './Intro'

export const RemotionVideo: React.FC = () => {
  return (
    <>
	  <Composition
		id="FullVideo"
		component={Intro}
		durationInFrames={450}
		fps={30}
		width={1920}
		height={1080}
	  />
	</>
  )
}
```

Here we can set many properties of our video:


1. The `id` is used to label the video in the editor.
2. The `component` that the video will be rendered from.
3. The `durationInFrames` is set to 450, which when divided by `fps` leaves us with 15 seconds of video.
4. `fps` or frames per second.
5. `width` and `height` of the video.


I decided to make my first composition be the Intro. Here is what my `Intro.tsx` looks like:

```typescript
import { AbsoluteFill, Sequence } from "remotion"
import { Title } from "./Title"
import { colors } from "./config/colors"
import { fonts } from "./config/fonts"


export const Intro = () => {
  return (
	<>
	  <AbsoluteFill style={{
		backgroundColor: colors.bgDark,
		textAlign: "center",
		color: colors.textWhite,
		fontSize: fonts.fontSize,
	  }}>
	  </AbsoluteFill>
	</>
  )
}
```

I have a config file where I set the general colors I wanted, just to make it easy to update later if needed.

I have an `AbsoluteFill` component, which is basically a `div` that is absolutely positioned in the center of the frame. I have the basics, like `backgroundColor` and `fontSize` set on this so they will be the same across all the frames in the intro.

Now, I would like to add text to the screen. To accomplish this, I will create some new components and wrap them in the `Sequence` tag:

```typescript

		<>
			<AbsoluteFill style={{
				backgroundColor: colors.bgDark,
				textAlign: "center",
				color: colors.textWhite,
				fontSize: fonts.fontSize,
			}}>
				<Sequence durationInFrames={150}>
					<Title />
				</Sequence>
				<Sequence from={150} durationInFrames={450}>
					<Instructions />
				</Sequence>
			</AbsoluteFill>
		</>
```

The `Sequence` tag basically allows us to render components starting at a certain point in the Composition. Here I have a `Title` component that renders at the very beginning of the Composition. The `Instructions` component does not come onto the screen until frame 150, as specified by the `from` attribute.

By the way, the entire component is wrapped in a fragment because I will be adding an `Audio` component later. This library uses React, so I will need to have both of these inside one element in the return statement.

## Adding Animations

For my `Title` component, I decided to attempt some animations. Here is what the component looks like:

```typescript
import { interpolate, useCurrentFrame, AbsoluteFill } from "remotion"
import { colors } from './config/colors'
import { fonts } from "./config/fonts"

export const Title = () => {
	const frame = useCurrentFrame()
	return (
		<AbsoluteFill style={{
			justifyContent: "center",
			alignItems: "center",
		}}>
			<h1>How to Complete Your <br/> Pop Star Research 
             Assignment</h1>
			<p>Mr. Baker</p>
		</AbsoluteFill>
	)
}
```

The `useCurrentFrame` hook allows us to get the current frame number. Remember that this React component is being rendered over and over to create our video.

This design is not the most interesting, so I want to add some animation. Let's add a fade in effect:

```typescript
export const Title = () => {
	const frame = useCurrentFrame()
	const opacity = interpolate(frame, [0,30], [0, 1], {
		extrapolateRight: "clamp",
	})
	return (
		<AbsoluteFill style={{
			justifyContent: "center",
			alignItems: "center",
			opacity,
		}}>
			<h1>How to Complete Your <br/> Pop Star Research 
             Assignment</h1>
			<p>Mr. Baker</p>
		</AbsoluteFill>
	)
}
```

Here we are using the `interpolate` helper function. This function takes four arguments:

1. The input value
2. The range values which the input can assume
3. The range of values that you want to map the input to
4. Optional settings

`extrapolateRight` being set to "clamp" makes sure that the value never goes above 1.

Finally, we assign the opacity property to the `AbsoluteFill`. Now we will have a slow fade in!

## Making the Rest of the Video

Most of the rest of the video was made using these same strategies. I designed all of the layouts using React and CSS. 

## Adding Audio

Once I finished the video, I decided to add audio to make the video more captivating for my students. Because I am a music producer, I decided to use my favorite Digital Audio Workstation (DAW), Logic Pro X, to record and edit my audio. 

You do not need Logic Pro to record your audio, though. You could record with any program or device. Once I finished recording and editing, All I had to do was add them in as an `Audio` component:

```typescript
	<>
		<AbsoluteFill />
			{/* components go here */}
		</AbsoluteFill />
		<Audio src={staticFile('intro.mp3')}
	</>
```

To load assets, you can keep them in a folder called `public`. You can use the `staticFile` method to add the file.

Remotion also has `Iframe` and `Image`  components that you should use over the traditional HTML elements. They will, like this one, take a `src` attribute.

## The Final Step: Rendering the Video

Now that the video was complete, all that was left to do was render it. To render a video, there is a `build` script built into the `package.json` file generated by Remotion. Make sure to adjust the script to contain the correct Composition to render and the correct location to save the video to.

```json
"build": "remotion render src/index.tsx FullVideo out/PopStarResearchOverview.mp4",
```

One issue I ran into was that you can only render one Composition at a time. To render the entire video, I had to create a new `Full Video` component and render all of the components from each composition into one component. Then, I imported that into the main `Video.tsx` file as the `FullVideo` composition. This is what I exported.
